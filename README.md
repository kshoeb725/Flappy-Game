## 🐦 Flappy Bird Game using  Java

A simple clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game built using **Java Swing**. This project demonstrates 2D game development concepts like game loops, event handling, collision detection, and image rendering — all packed in a fun, playable arcade game.

### 🚀 Features
- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics
- Keyboard controls using `SPACEBAR` to make the bird flap
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart functionality
- Uses `JPanel`, `Timer`, and `KeyListener` for game logic and UI

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (Swing)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Basic 2D graphics and event handling

### 📂 Project Structure
- `APP.java` – Initializes the main game window and sets up the frame
- `FlappyBird.java` – Handles game logic, rendering, key events, and animations

2. Add the game assets (`flappybird.png`, `flappybirdbg.png`, `toppipe.png`, `bottompipe.png`) to the root directory.
3. Compile and run the xxgame:
   ```bash
   javac APP.java FlappyBird.java
   java APP
   ```
